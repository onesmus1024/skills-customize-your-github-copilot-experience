# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to build and test RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. Students will create endpoints, handle requests, and return JSON responses.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Task 1: Set Up FastAPI Project

#### Description
Set up a new FastAPI project and create a basic API endpoint that returns a welcome message.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Create a main application file (e.g., main.py)
- Define a root endpoint (`/`) that returns a JSON welcome message

### 🛠️ Task 2: Create CRUD Endpoints

#### Description
Implement RESTful endpoints for managing a simple resource (e.g., items or users).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Define endpoints for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations
- Use Python data structures (e.g., list or dict) to store resource data
- Return appropriate JSON responses for each operation

### 🛠️ Task 3: Test Your API

#### Description
Test your API using a tool like curl, HTTPie, or Postman.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Provide example commands for testing each endpoint
- Ensure all endpoints work as expected and return correct responses
